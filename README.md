This is an API for charging e-stations
The API:

    - realizes create, udpate, delete e-stations;
    - displays stations in the specified city;
    - displays stations in the specified city that are currently open;

I did not use some frontend stuff for displaying stations, only json responses.
To create API I:

    - used Docker and docker-compose
